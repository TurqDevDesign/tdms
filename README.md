<p>This is the git repository for the TURQ Development Module Sidebar. </p>
<p>Though it's currently still in production, TDMS is meant to be an easy-to-use, easy-to-implement, developer-centric content management system. The ultimate goal is to have an easily extendable, bare-bones CMS that implements a wide range of ready-made functions, on top of, and improving upon, many other features we've all come to know and love from other popular systems. </p>
